        Galar is based on the United Kingdom. The main part of Galar focuses
        heavily on the island of Great Britain, especially England and (to a
        lesser extent) Wales. However, the orientation of the landmass is
        rotated 180° compared to real-world Great Britain: for example, Northern
        Galar is based on southern England. The parts of Galar introduced in the
        Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass are based on other parts of the
        UK. The Isle of Armor is based on the Isle of Man, a self-governing
        crown dependency of the United Kingdom,and the Crown Tundra is based on
        Scotland. The Galar region is an expansive region, including varied
        environments such as idyllic countrysides, contemporary cities, and
        snow-covered mountains. Galar comprises a long mainland area as well as
        an outlying island area, the Isle of Armor, east of the mainland.
