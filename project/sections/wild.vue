      The Wild Area (Japanese: ワイルドエリア Wild Area) is an extensive area in
      the Galar region. It adjoins several towns in the region. The Pokémon
      found in the Wild Area vary depending on the weather, which can vary
      wildly between the different subareas. Pokémon with higher levels also
      wander outside of the normal tall grass in many places. The areas north of
      the Motostoke River are home to Pokémon with higher levels overall. Once
      the player has started the Darkest Day or captured Eternatus, Pokémon
      found throughout the Wild Area will generally have higher levels. Unlike
      in most other areas in the game (which use a fixed perspective), in the
      Wild Area the player can control the camera using the right control stick.
      These mechanics, as well as the weather and wild Pokémon mechanics, carry
      over to the Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra.
