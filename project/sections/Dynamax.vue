        Dynamax (Japanese: ダイマックス Daimax) is a temporary transformation
        affecting Pokémon that was introduced in Generation VIII. Trainers who
        obtain a Dynamax Band are able to Dynamax their Pokémon. According to
        Professor Magnolia, the Pokémon distorts space to change its size while
        affecting the world around them. This transformation has another special
        variant known as Gigantamax. If a Pokémon has the Gigantamax Factor, it
        can undergo Gigantamax, a special kind of Dynamax that results in a
        different appearance to its regular form in addition to being larger.
        Only specific individual members of a select group of species can
        Gigantamax. Each Gigantamax Pokémon has an exclusive Max Move known as a
        G-Max Move. Other than having a G-Max Move, Gigantamax is functionally
        identical to a Dynamax.

        Dynamaxing increases a Pokémon's size drastically, as well as changing
        the moves of the Pokémon and doubling their max and current HP in battle
        (except for Shedinja), but can only be used once during a battle, and
        ends after three turns or if the user is switched out. In addition, it
        can only be performed in areas known to have Power Spots, such as
        Galar's Gym Stadiums, Battle Court, and Battle Tower. When Dynamaxed,
        all of the Pokémon's moves will turn into Max Moves that correspond to
        those moves' types and categories. Like with Mega Evolution, Dynamax is
        activated at the start of the turn before all other moves are executed.
        If a Dynamax Pokémon runs out of PP of one move, it still can be
        selected but fails; if it is unable to use any moves (e.g., running out
        of PP), it will use Struggle. In a Max Raid Battle, the wild Pokémon is
        a Dynamax Pokémon for the entire duration of the battle. Only one of the
        Trainers' Pokémon can Dynamax during a Max Raid Battle, and only for the
        standard three turns. The first Trainer with the chance to Dynamax is
        the host, with the chance passing to the next player who joined until it
        returns to the first player. Zacian, Zamazenta, and Eternatus, including
        Pokémon transformed into one of these, cannot Dynamax.
