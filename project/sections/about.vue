    <p class="text">
      Galar is based on the United Kingdom. The main part of Galar focuses
      heavily on the island of Great Britain, especially England and (to a
      lesser extent) Wales. However, the orientation of the landmass is rotated
      180° compared to real-world Great Britain: for example, Northern Galar is
      based on southern England. The parts of Galar introduced in the Pokémon
      Sword and Shield Expansion Pass are based on other parts of the UK. The
      Isle of Armor is based on the Isle of Man, a self-governing crown
      dependency of the United Kingdom,and the Crown Tundra is based on
      Scotland. The Galar region is an expansive region, including varied
      environments such as idyllic countrysides, contemporary cities, and
      snow-covered mountains. Galar comprises a long mainland area as well as an
      outlying island area, the Isle of Armor, east of the mainland.
